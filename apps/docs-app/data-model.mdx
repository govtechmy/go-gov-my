Whether you are using GoGovMy's [API](/api-reference/introduction) or not, this page is a quick way to understand how GoGovMy works.

Within GoGovMy, all data belongs to a [**Workspace**](#workspace). Within a workspace, you have [Links](#links), [Domains](#domains), [Tags](#tags), and more.

## Workspace

[Workspaces](https://github.com/govtechmy/go-gov-my/discussions) is the defacto way of organizing your links and working with your team on GoGovMy. You can think of a GoGovMy workspace like a workspace on Slack or Discord â€“ it's a shared space where you can [invite your team members](https://github.com/govtechmy/go-gov-my/discussions) to collaborate on links.

When interacting with GoGovMy's API, you will also need to specify the [Workspace ID](/api-reference/introduction#workspace-id) to perform any operation. You can find the workspace ID under the **General** settings page of your workspace.

## Links

Links are the bread and butter of GoGovMy. You can shorten any URL to a GoGovMy link, which you can then share with your audience. Links can be [created](/api-reference/endpoint/create-a-new-link), [updated](/api-reference/endpoint/edit-a-link), and [deleted](/api-reference/endpoint/delete-a-link) via the [GoGovMy API](/api-reference/introduction) or the [GoGovMy dashboard](https://app.dub.co).

## Domains

On GoGovMy, you can [add custom domains](https://github.com/govtechmy/go-gov-my/discussions) to create branded short links for better brand recognition. You can also [set a primary domain](https://github.com/govtechmy/go-gov-my/discussions) for it to be used as the default domain for new links (both via the API and the dashboard).

## Tags

Tags are a way to organize your links. You can [add tags to your links](https://github.com/govtechmy/go-gov-my/discussions) to categorize them and make them easier to find. You can also [filter analytics by tags](https://github.com/govtechmy/go-gov-my/discussions) to get a better understanding of how your campaigns are performing.
